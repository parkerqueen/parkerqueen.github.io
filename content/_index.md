Hi! I'm *Soban Raza* (pseudonym: Parker Queen), an undergraduate student of Computer Science at FAST-NUCES, Islamabad. I'll be graduating this July apparently. 

I have developed a real fondness for computers, an infatuation almost. I keep alternating between the different branches of CS such as Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Computing and Software Engineering. I enjoy cracking challenging problems and CS provides me plenty.
