Hi! I'm *Soban Raza* (pseudonym: Parker Queen), a Software Engineer at Educative, Inc. I graduated in BS(CS) from FAST-NUCES in July, 2021.

I have developed a real fondness for computers, an infatuation almost. I keep alternating between the different branches of CS such as Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Computing, Computer Graphics and Software Engineering. I enjoy cracking challenging problems and CS provides me plenty. Find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Utt7nOvPmQjTtW6LfkBzDT8x5LAaniAV/view?usp=sharing).
